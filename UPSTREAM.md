# UPSTREAM.md — sigsurvey-rf

> **Read this before contributing.**

## What this repo is

A Cognis Digital **military/IC adaptation layer** that sits *on top of* an
unmodified upstream open-source project. The upstream code is **not vendored**
in this repo — operators clone it separately.

## Upstream project

- **Repo**: https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio
- **License**: GPL-3.0-or-later
- **Forked at commit**: PLACEHOLDER (operator pins at deployment time)

## What Cognis Digital adds

- FCC/NTIA band-plan lookup (public allocations only)
- Federal/DoD/GPS band-violation detector
- CSV survey ingestor
- All band data is from PUBLIC FCC 47 CFR §2.106 + NTIA Red Book public version. No classified band plans.

## License posture

- This repo's *additions* are licensed under the file in `LICENSE`.
- The combined work (upstream + Cognis additions) inherits the upstream license
  if you redistribute together.
- We do **not** redistribute upstream code in this repo — `mil-additions/` is a
  separate module that calls/wraps upstream binaries.

## Upgrading the upstream

```
cd upstream/
git pull
git log --oneline ${LAST_TESTED_SHA}..HEAD     # review changes
# Then re-run our test suite against the new upstream
```

## Why we ship as an additions layer

1. **Legal clarity** — upstream license rules upstream code; ours rules ours.
2. **Operational** — operators on classified networks already have the
   upstream binary blessed by their ATO. We don't ask them to re-evaluate it.
3. **Maintenance** — we can ride upstream releases without re-forking.

## What's unclassified / EAR99

Everything in this repo is unclassified, public-release, EAR99 (no export
license required). Classification markings in code/output are
**operator-supplied placeholders**.
